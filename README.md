## About the Air Quality Monitoring System
This project is a part of my thesis work aimed at developing an IoT-based and web-based air quality monitoring system.

## Background
Air pollution is a critical issue that affects the health and well-being of people around the globe. The need for accurate and real-time air quality monitoring has never been more urgent. This system provides a solution by utilizing IoT devices to gather air quality data and a web interface to display and analyze this data.

## Technologies Used
- NodeMCU
- MQ-135 Gas Sensor
- MySQL
- Laravel 10
- PHP 8.1.29

## Main Features
- Real-time air quality data collection using NodeMCU and MQ-135 sensor.
- Data storage and management using MySQL database.
- Web interface built with Laravel for data visualization and analysis.
- WebSocket for real-time data updates on the web interface.
- Alerts and notifications for users when air quality levels exceed safe limits.

## Benefits
The air quality monitoring system provides numerous benefits, including:
<ol>
    <li>Helping individuals and communities stay informed about air quality in their area.</li>
    <li>Providing real-time data that can be used by researchers and policymakers to make informed decisions.</li>
    <li>Increasing awareness about the impact of air pollution on health and the environment.</li>
</ol>
